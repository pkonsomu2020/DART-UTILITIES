    2. Write a program that uses a for loop to print out the numbers from 1 to 10.
    3. Create a program that uses a switch statement to check for different string values and output a response based on the value.
    4. Create a program that uses a while loop to print out the numbers from 20 to 10.
    5. Create a program that uses an if-else statement to check if a number is even or odd and output the result.
    6. Create a program that takes a list of numbers as input and outputs the largest number in the list.
    7. Write a program that uses a try-catch block to catch an exception and output an error message.
